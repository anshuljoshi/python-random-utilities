## Youtube playlist downloader

USAGE:
```
$ python youplaylistdl.py <URLofPlaylist>/<PageSource> Option(default=0(videos), 1(only audio), 2(provide pagesource))
```

Option-2 (Pagesource) is needed when there are more than 100 videos in the Playlist. Then Option-0 won't be able to download after 100 videos.

To get the URL of all the videos you need to specifically click "Load More".

Option-2 (Pagesource) is a workaround.

Manually go to URL. Click "Load More". Copy the pagesource to a file and provide the page source to the program.
